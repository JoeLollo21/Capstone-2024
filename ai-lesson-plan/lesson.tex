The \textit{Minecraft Misinfo Game} is a live, interactive event played by teams of 2-3 players with a game host.  It emulates a “rabbit hole effect” of Internet usage, where the first pieces of evidence are believable, but become more outrageous over time.

In the game, the player starts out on a spaceship with the goal of finding the Dragon Tear, a medicine to cure their best friend Missy’s sickness, but gets sidetracked into believing misinformation about possibly dangerous aliens that the ship’s captain has detected.

The game uses \textit{Minecraft: Education Edition} (Beta 1.20.12), and the specific \textit{Minecraft} world can be downloaded here. 

\subsection{Game Structure}
There are two parts to the \textit{Minecraft Misinfo Game}:

1.	\textbf{Gameplay }(Approximately 45 minutes): The misinformation game, with host and facilitation. 

2.	\textbf{Debrief} (Approximately 15 minutes): The facilitated discussion among players after the game. The opportunity to reflect on the experience is when the most learning occurs!
